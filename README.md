Implementing CamillaDSP on a Raspberry Pi 5 on a 10.1" Touch screen

Following https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/rpi-camilladsp-tutorial.29656/ I built CamillaDSP running on a Raspberry Pi 5 to tri-amp a pair of modified Klipschorns, a USB connected Motu UltraLite Mk.5 provides the balanced analog output to the three stereo amplifiers.

Initially I ran Squeezelite on the Raspberry Pi with CamillaDSP and controlled it via a  PiCorePlayer on another Raspberry Pi running on a 7" screen. I then tried installing and running JiveLite on the RPi 5 with CamillaDSP instead of SqueezeLite and attached a 7" touch screen. As well as the streaming facility, JiveLite provides player controls and display. This worked fairly well, but could be improved with a bit more screen space to avoid swapping from app to app, so I bought a Waveshare 10.1" touch screen with a stand and provision for mounting a RPi on the back. By running the Raspberry Pi desktop OS instead of Raspberry Pi Lite and adding an on-screen keyboard there is now full control of the internet browser for CamillaDSP without the need for an attached keyboard. 

Components - 
Raspberry Pi 5 and 32GB SD card.
